    "This notebook contains a demonstration of new features present in the 0.50.0 release of Numba. Whilst release notes are produced as part of the [`CHANGE_LOG`](https://github.com/numba/numba/blob/release0.50/CHANGE_LOG), there's nothing like seeing code in action! This release contains a few new features, but it's mainly internals that have changed!\n",

    "Key internal changes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Numba is now backed by LLVM 9.\n",
    "* NumPy 1.18 support is added.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Demonstrations of new features/changes include:\n",
    "* [New error messages](#New-error-messages)\n",
    "* [Jitclass ``@staticmethod``](#Jitclass-@staticmethod-support)\n",
